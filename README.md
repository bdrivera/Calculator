Calculator is an HTML, CSS, and Javascript project created by Bret Rivera during The Odin Project curriculum. My goal for this assignment was to meet the main goals of the assignment while adding extra functionality to show growth over the course of the project.

The goal of the assignment is as such: Create a webpage with a graphic user interface calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should also be capable of displaying functions and input in real time. The calculator will also include quality of life features to include rounding of long decimals and protection from invalid inputs.
